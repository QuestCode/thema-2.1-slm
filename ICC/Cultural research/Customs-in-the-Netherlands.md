# Customs in the Netherlands

### Greetings

- When entering a room it is customary to shake hands with everyone present, then to shake hands again on leaving. If there are too many people to shake hands with and the setting is informal, publicly identifying yourself will suffice. Usually an acquaintance will introduce a visitor to others; otherwise the guest introduces himself. The Dutch consider it impolite not to identify oneself. 
- When introducing themselves, the Dutch shake hands and say their name (first and/or surname).
- If seated, it is polite to stand up before shaking hands.
- When answering the phone, the receiving party identifies him-/herself first either using their first (Jan), or last name (Jansen) or both (Jan Jansen). The name is usually preceded by "met", which means (you're speaking) with. The caller is expected to identify themselves before asking to speak to another person or talking about something else. 
- It is polite to ask where to sit.
- The Dutch use one hand to shake hands and typically let go after a very short time. Continuing to hold on to someone's hand is mostly considered inappropriate.

### Body language

- The Dutch expect eye contact while speaking with someone. Looking away or staring at the ground is considered impolite and may be perceived as disinterest or lying.
- The Dutch tend to be reserved in using hand gestures. However, having your hands in pockets or arms crossed might be interpreted as a sign of disinterest.
- The crazy sign is made by tapping the centre of your forehead with your index finger. This gesture is considered rude.
- To make things more complex, the sign indicating someone is smart or intelligent is made by tapping the area around temporal bone (just above the ear) with the index finger.
- To make things even more complex, the crazy sign can also be made by twisting your index finger around the temporal bone. However, there is a slight distinction: This particular gesture indicates insanity, whereas tapping the forehead usually indicates stupidity.
- Using the middle finger for pointing something out (like on a map) is not considered rude, but it does draw attention.
- When yawning, coughing or sneezing, the mouth should be covered with a flat hand or fist.

### Conversation and language

- The Dutch avoid superlatives. Compliments are offered sparingly. When something is "not bad", "okay" or "nice", it should be perceived as praise for the recipient.
- The Dutch speak directly and use a lot of eye contact. To a foreigner this may seem intimidating, especially in cultures where matters are discussed with extreme care and politeness, but it is the way the Dutch prefer to communicate. This is even more so in Dutch corporate society.
- Discussing expensive items purchased recently (or anything similar) will be seen as boasting. Asking personal questions is equally dangerous, as the Dutch are private and feel uncomfortable answering questions they deem too personal. These problems can be avoided at least partially by acknowledging in advance that a question is rude or intrusive. One can ask permission to ask the question anyway if there is real need. This leaves the other person the opportunity to refuse to answer. If so, it is considered extremely rude to ask the question anyway.
- This especially includes asking about income or other personal finances; asking how much someone earns will be seen as rude, and volunteering your own income as pretentious.
- The Dutch don't have a problem with saying No directly to someone's face. This is not considered impolite, but simply honest.
- This honesty also translates into the willingness to answer questions, it is often better to ask several questions (on anything), than to keep quiet and potentially misinterpret situations.
- Almost no subject is taboo in conversation, as long as it is discussed in general. Someone's personal affairs are usually off-limits, unless the person concerned brings up the matter him-/herself.
- As a reserved people, the Dutch (especially the older generation) consider it rude to interfere with someone's personal business, though it is considered proper to interfere in a physical fight, or an exchange of words, should it seem likely physical violence is about to occur.
- Whispering in the presence of other people is considered impolite. A whispered conversation in the company of unacquainted people in a relatively confined public place may also be considered impolite.
- Relatively loud conversations in public are not uncommon. However, they may be frowned upon.
- Loud mobile phone conversations in public are common, even in public transport, but considered rude by many. Quiet carriages have been introduced by the railways, but these are generally ignored.
- It is socially acceptable to politely ask someone making noise (in the form of speech or music) in a quiet carriage to move elsewhere. After such a request is made it is considered extremely rude for the offending person to continue his or her behavior.


### Business etiquette

- Business can be discussed during lunch. Business breakfasts are not common. Spouses or partners are often included in a business dinner.
- It is normal to ask if the host expects a spouse to be present at a business function.
- Business matters are usually not discussed when partners are present or following the conversation.
- Gifts are generally not given or expected at business meetings as they are only exchanged in business once a close, personal relationship has developed.
- The Dutch find any form of ostentation embarrassing. A grand gesture of generosity will make them uncomfortable. Displays of wealth which are too obvious are considered bad taste and will most likely get a negative response.
- The Dutch take punctuality for business meetings seriously and expect others will do likewise; it is wise to call with an explanation if you are delayed for more than five minutes. Lateness, missed appointments, postponements, changing the time of an appointment or a late delivery lessens trust and can ruin relationships.
- Calling half an hour or less before the start of a meeting to change the time is considered bad manners. The main reason behind this is probably the scheduled nature of Dutch business. Punctuality increases efficiency.
- An individual's cooperation and trust are valued over performance; one-upmanship is frowned upon.
- The Dutch tend to be direct, giving straight "yes and no" answers. They are conservative and forceful and can be stubborn and tough negotiators. They are willing to innovate or experiment, but with minimal risk.
- Companies are frugal. Business is profit-oriented. However, though the strategy is cautious and pragmatic, usually involving step-by-step plans, the Dutch are not obsessed with numbers. Strategy is clear and communicated to all levels. In many companies the decision-making is slow and ponderous, involving wide consultation and boardroom meetings (“poldermodel”). The Dutch do not appreciate the "I call the shots" mentality, instead they keep talking until all parties agree. Once decisions are made, implementation is fast and efficient.
- In the Netherlands, commitments are taken seriously. Do not promise anything that cannot be delivered. A spoken agreement with others present has the same worth as a signed contract even from a legal viewpoint.
- This also applies in reverse. If the Dutch express uncertainty about their ability to deliver something, this is usually not a negotiation trick or a polite attempt at refusal, but an honest warning. In fact, it may be a good indication that the other party will try to deliver, but may face some problems or delays. The Dutch usually "err on the side of caution" in such matters to avoid making promises they cannot keep.
