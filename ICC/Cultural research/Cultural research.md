With a surface area of more than 41,000 km2, and a population of around 17 million people, the Netherlands is one of the world’s most populous countries. A quarter of the Netherlands’ land area lies below sea level. The low-lying areas consist mainly of polders, flat stretches of land surrounded by dikes where the water table is controlled artificially.

The Netherlands, which shares it borders with Germany and Belgium, is often referred to as “Holland”, the identity of the two western coastal provinces, North and South Holland, which are at the core of the country and have played a dominant role in the history of the Netherlands. Thanks to their location on to the Rhine-Maas estuary, these provinces are very important for the economy. They also contain the country’s principal administrative and commercial cities – Amsterdam, The Hague (Den Haag) and Rotterdam. Together with Utrecht, the capital of the province of Utrecht, they form the combined area of what is known as the Randstad conurbation, with a population of around 7 million.

The politics of the Netherlands take place within the framework of a parliamentary representative democracy, a constitutional monarchy and a decentralised unitary state. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state.[2] Dutch politics and governance are characterised by a common striving for broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole.

Religion in the Netherlands was predominantly Christian until late into the 20th century. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence. The Netherlands is one of the most secular countries in Western Europe, with only 39% being religiously affiliated (31% for those aged under 35), and fewer than 5.6% visiting church regularly (meaning once or more per month) in 2010. Religion is in the Netherlands generally considered a personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public.

The Netherlands has a maritime climate, with cool summers and mild winters. The average temperature is 2°C in January and 19°C in July, with an annual average of about 10°C. Clouds generally appear every day, and in the winter months fog often abounds, while rainfall occurs frequently.

### Lithuania

Lithuania is a relatively small country in the northern part of Europe. The largest among the three Baltic States, it neighbours Latvia and Belarus to the north and to the southeast, respectively. To the south, the country borders Poland and to the southwest the Russian exclave of the Kaliningrad Oblast. Reaching 65,300 km2, Lithuania’s land mass is larger than that of Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium or Denmark. Lithuania has approximately 91 km of sandy coastline; however, no more than 38 km of these face the open Baltic Sea. The remaining length of the coast is along the Curonian Spit. Lithuania has an ice-free port in Klaipëda, which is the largest and most important transport hub in the country and links routes through sea, land and railway from both East and West. The climate can be classed as between maritime and continental, with wet, moderate summers and winters. Lithuania is in the Eastern European Time Zone and adheres to CET (UTC +2) during the winter and EEST (UTC +3) during the summer.

Lithuania has had an interesting history. At the end of the 14th century, the country was the largest in Europe and later it formed a union with Poland creating a single dual state, which was only dismantled in 1795. Lithuania recovered its freedom after World War I; however, it was annexed by the USSR in 1940. Fifty years later, it was the first Baltic State to declare its independence from Russia, on the 11th of March 1990.

The Lithuanian population is more than three million people, mostly comprised of Lithuanians, but also Poles, Russians, Belarusians and other ethnic groups. The main religions are Roman Catholicism and Russian Orthodox.

Politics of Lithuania takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of Lithuania is the head of government, and of a multi-party system.

As per the 2011 census, the predominant religion in Lithuania is Christianity, with the largest confession being Roman Catholicism. Lithuania was the last pagan country in Europe, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming widely accepted only in the late 14th century. In the early 21st century, about 77% of the population is Roman Catholic according to the 2011 census. There are also smaller groups of Evangelical Lutherans and Reformed churches other Protestants, as well as people of other faiths. Some elements of the ancient Lithuanian pagan religion survives in the countryside, mingled with Christianity.

Executive power is exercised by the government, which is headed by the Prime Minister. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the unicameral Seimas (Lithuanian Parliament). Judicial power is vested in judges appointed by the President of Lithuania and is independent of executive and legislature power. The judiciary consists of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Court of Appeal as well as the separate administrative courts. The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania established these powers upon its approval on October 25, 1992. Being a multi-party system, the government of Lithuania is not dominated by any single political party, rather it consists of numerous parties that must work with each other to form coalition governments.

##### Tips for Dutchies
1.	Try to guide the conversation in the right direction, but of course prevent coming across as rude.
2.	Ask open questions during the first (or first few) meetings.
3.	Don't be taken aback if you don't see clear signs of appreciation. Ask for confirmation if you're unclear about their opinion.
4.  The decision-making process in Lithuania is relatively quick. You simply have to agree on a specific date with your partner, and a decision will be ready by that date.

### Breaking the ice
Any topic of discussion is good to start a conversation with. You can talk about family, work, hobbies and sports. Lithuanians are fond of basketball and their national team is among the best in the world.

People are referred to by their title and surname. Colleagues and supervisors are usually referred to by their first name with Ponas (Mr), Panele (Ms) or Ponia (Mrs) or by title: Doctor, Professor, Director, Principle etc. and sometimes including last names. It is important not to address someone by their first name until invited to do so.

It is advisable to use the information on their business card to determine how to address an associate. So, if he or she has a title written in front of their name, then you should address the person by their title and surname

During a first meeting, Lithuanians will try to be formal and polite, listening very diligently. They like to ask questions to be sure that they understand what you are saying. Usually, Lithuanians like to build a personal relationship with potential partners before moving the conversation to business. It is essential that you try to speed up this process, as it is critical to the success of the discussion and doing business in Lithuania.

### Business hierarchy
77% of the Lithuanian population is roman catholic. Because of the strong hierarchy inside the roman catholic church in Lithuania and the big impact the church has on everyday life, these hierarchical trends carry on into the business aspects of the Lithuanian culture.  

There is a strong sense of hierarchy within every part of the culture, this means that showing respect and deference to people of a higher authority is important. At the same time, bragging or overstating your higher authority when you are in this position is frowned upon, as most Lithuanians are very modest. It is also important to note that it is not uncommon for Lithuanian companies to have a strict hierarchy wherein senior-level businessmen only speak with people of the same rank. This could seem arrogant or even rude to some cultures.  

In comparison, the Dutch usually have a significantly less strict hierarchy. Hierarchies in the Netherlands tend to have productivity as a goal, and function less as a way of respect or authority above another person.

#### Tips for Dutchies
1. Key tip here is to keep in mind that not all Lithuanian companies will adhere to such a strict hierarchy, but to know that IF they do. Try to figure out your place in the conversation and do not be offended if a highly-ranked person in the company speaks less often to you (or not at all).

## What to do in Groningen

Although Groningen is not a very large city, it does have an important role as the main urban centre of this part of the country, particularly in the fields of music and other arts, education, and business. The large number of students living in Groningen also contributes to a diverse cultural scene for a city of its size. This chapter will cover things you can do in the city of Groningen.

### Museums

The most important and most famous museum in Groningen is the Groninger Museum. With the construction of its current building, designed by Alessandro Mendini, the museum has been transformed into one of the most modern and innovative of its kind in the Netherlands. In addition, the city also has a maritime museum, a university museum, a comics museum and a graphical museum.

### Sightseeing

Last but not least Groningen is a great place for sightseeing. The city is more than 500 years old which means that there are many old buildings to be watched. Probably the biggest sightseeing attraction is the church located on the Grote Markt called the Martinikerk, which has a large tower called the Martinitoren. The Martinitoren can be scaled by stair to get a nice view of Groningen.

Other sightseeing attractions in the center of Groningen are city hall, The Korenbeurs (a building where crops and goods were traded many years ago but now functions as a supermarket), another church called the AA Kerk and the main building of the University of Groningen.

### Nightlife

Groningen has a wide variety of bars and clubs to entertain the large population of students that live in the city. Almost every street in Groningen has at least one bar on it, which amounts to more than a hundred bars spread across Groningen.
