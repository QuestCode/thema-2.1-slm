Lithuania is a relatively small country in northern Europe. The largest of the three Baltic States. It neighbours Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Kaliningrad (Russian exclave). Lithuania's land mass is larger than the Netherlands.

Lithuania has an interesting history. During the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, and later formed a union with Poland, this Unian was dismantled in 1795.

Politics of Lithuania are democratic, the Prime Minister of Lithuania is the head of government, and there is a multi-party system.

The elderly in Lithuania most likely speak only Lithuanian or only Russian. Their children, currently the middle age-generation, will most likely speak a few more languages, such as Ukrainian or Polish, but usually not English. It is just more recently that English has began infiltrating Lithuania, and it is the younger generations (20s and younger) that have taken an interest in becoming fluent.

During the 2011 census, it was determined that the predominant religion in Lithuania is Christianity. The far majority of the Christians in Lithuania are Roman Catholicist. About 77% of the population is Roman Catholic according to the census.

| Don't have problems saying no or giving their opinion up front                                     | Saying no is troublesome during the first stages of acquaintanceship.                                     |

##### Tips for Dutch people
1.	Try to guide the conversation in the right direction, but of course prevent coming across as rude.
2.	Ask open questions during the first (or first few) meetings.
3.	Don't be taken aback if you don't see clear signs of appreciation. Ask for confirmation if you're unclear about their opinion.
4.  The decision-making process in Lithuania is relatively quick. You simply have to agree on a specific date with your partner, and a decision will be ready by that date.

##### Tips for Lithuanian people
1. Don't be afraid to say no, Dutch people will not be offended by it.
2. Try not to take it as an insult when someone Dutch seems very direct. This __can__ be a good quality so that everyone knows each other's opinion. Besides, most Dutch people will not be aware of this tendency.

### Breaking the ice
Any topic of discussion is good to start a conversation with. You can talk about family, work, hobbies and sports. Lithuanians are fond of basketball and their national team is among the best in the world.
Talking about money is not an issue.

Do not suggest that Lithuanians are basically Russian, Lithuanians are proud to be independent. Do not start about the Eurovision song contest. The first time Lithuania participated they finished last, without a single point. After that, Lithuania withdrew and didn’t return until 1999. It just went downhill from there. Stick to sport subjects, that is their strong suit.

People are referred to by their title and surname. Colleagues and supervisors are usually referred to by their first name with Ponas (Mr), Panele (Ms) or Ponia (Mrs) or by title: Doctor, Professor, Director, Principle etc. and sometimes including last names. It is important not to address someone by their first name until invited to do so.

It is advisable to use the information on their business card to determine how to address an associate. So, if he or she has a title written in front of their name, then you should address the person by their title and surname

During a first meeting, Lithuanians will try to be formal and polite, listening very diligently. They like to ask questions to be sure that they understand what you are saying. Usually, Lithuanians like to build a personal relationship with potential partners before moving the conversation to business. It is essential that you try to speed up this process, as it is critical to the success of the discussion and doing business in Lithuania.

##### Tips for Dutch people
1. Try starting with a light discussion. You can talk about family, work, hobbies and sports.
2. Use the name and title on the business cards to address your conversation partner.
3. Be friendly and try to build a personal relationship as soon as possible.

##### Tips for Lithuanian people
1. Do not be afraid of breaking the ice, even if a spontaneous joke or informal conversation seems odd. This is common in Dutch culture.
2. If you do not like being called by your first name, do not call Dutch people by their first name either. Alternatively you could take the more direct approach by telling them you do not like being called by your first name. Because directness is also appreciated within Dutch culture.

### Meetings
Meetings are attended by employees of similar status. A list of attendees and their functions is expected in the invitation. Business in Lithuania is generally a hierarchical afair. The chair of the meeting is likely the most senior attendee. He will determine the pace and decide who can speak. During the opening of the meeting the chair will do the introductions in order of seniority. Junior members mostly only respond to direct questions from senior members.

An agenda is used and followed sequentially.

Meetings should be short and well prepared. All relevant information should be present and questions need direct answers. Because of the strong hierarchy within businesses most decision are made by the most senior member. Any negotations should also be done with the most senior member because of this. You should never interrupt a speaker and wait patiently to talk.

The chair concludes the meeting with a summary of the discussion.

##### Presentations
Presentations should be short and concise and include data to support your position. Be prepared to answer any question anybody may have directly after the presentation.

### Negotiation Process
Decisions tend to be made from the top down. Avoid hard selling tactics and any sort of conflict or confrontational approach. It is always helpful to know a few words in the native language as a sign of respect and this will undoubtedly generate a friendlier response. Lithuanians prefer face-to-face meetings and do not give their trust easily. So if you want to do business in Lithuania, you have to build some trust first.

Lithuanians expect that any unsolicited approach is an attempt to sell them something and they expect the worst scenario. Business managers who do business with Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe make personal relationships first, business comes later.

### Psychological factors that determine behaviour

It is important to avoid interrupting someone while they are speaking. Also, Lithuanians don't like long meetings, and will get annoyed if a meeting takes to long. This might affect the way they do business.

Lithuanians are typically modest in the work place. They usually speak in a calm and non emotive way without the use of unnecessary hand gestures and it is important therefore, that you remain collected during your meetings as any outbursts could lead to the dissolution of the relationship. They are also extremely polite during any interactions and it is considered rude to interrupt someone who is already speaking.



---

##### Minutes

The minutes of the meeting should summarize the main points of discussion, the decisions that were taken and the methods by which the desired results may be achieved. The minutes are sent by the party that is hosting the meeting and should be sent within a couple of days after the meeting. Irrespective of the outcome of the meeting, it is custom to write to your hosts and express thanks for their time and effort. Sending a follow-up email shows that you care and are prepared to make the effort required to form a good business relationship.

### Punctuality
| Dutch                                                                                                    | Lithuania                                                          |
| -------                                                                                                  | -----------                                                        |
| Punctuality regarded as virtue                                                                           | Usually on time, expects partner to be on time                     |
| Accept apologies for late arrival                                                                        | Expect partner to notify them when partner is unexpectedly delayed |
| Calling half an hour or less before the start of a meeting to change the time is considered bad manners. | Use time as a tactic, especially if they know you have a deadline  |

##### Tips for Dutch people
1. Arrive for a meeting 10 minutes beforehand to decrease the chances of arriving late.
2. Give the Lithuanians a call when you might arrive late.
3. Lithuanians will not be rushed into making a deal until they believe it is in their best interest
4. Meetings often conclude with a summary of the discussion and a toast to future business

##### Tips for Lithuanian people
1. Dutch people may not pay as much respect to punctuality as you do, try emphasise on this during contact beforehand (without sounding accusing).
2. If you are late, it is no problem to just apologise after entering.

### Business hierarchy
77% of the Lithuanian population is roman catholic. Because of the strong hierarchy inside the roman catholic church in Lithuania and the big impact the church has on everyday life, these hierarchical trends carry on into the business aspects of the Lithuanian culture.

There is a strong sense of hierarchy within every part of the culture, this means that showing respect and deference to people of a higher authority is important. At the same time, bragging or overstating your higher authority when you are in this position is frowned upon, as most Lithuanians are very modest. It is also important to note that it is not uncommon for Lithuanian companies to have a strict hierarchy wherein senior-level businessmen only speak with people of the same rank. This could seem arrogant or even rude to some cultures.

In comparison, the Dutch usually have a significantly less strict hierarchy. Hierarchies in the Netherlands tend to have productivity as a goal, and function less as a way of respect or authority above another person.

##### Tips for Dutch people
1. Key tip here is to keep in mind that __not all__ Lithuanian companies will adhere to such a strict hierarchy, but to know that __if__ they do. Try to figure out your place in the meeting and do not be offended if a highly-ranked person in the company speaks to you less often (or not at all).

##### Tips for Lithuanian people
1. If Dutch people might seem offended when someone higher-up in the hierarchy does not talk to them as much, try explaining that this is not personal and mostly habitual and ritualistic.

## What to do in Groningen
Although Groningen is not a very large city, it does have an important role as the main urban centre of this part of the country, particularly in the fields of music and other arts, education, and business. The large number of students living in Groningen also contributes to a diverse cultural scene for a city of its size. This chapter will cover things you can do in the city of Groningen.

### Museums
The most important and most famous museum in Groningen is the Groninger Museum. With the construction of its current building, designed by Alessandro Mendini, the museum has been transformed into one of the most modern and innovative of its kind in the Netherlands. In addition, the city also has a maritime museum, a university museum, a comics museum and a graphical museum.

### Sightseeing
Last but not least Groningen is a great place for sightseeing. The city is more than 500 years old which means that there are many old buildings to be watched. Probably the biggest sightseeing attraction is the church located on the Grote Markt called the Martinikerk, which has a large tower called the Martinitoren. The Martinitoren can be scaled by stair to get a nice view of Groningen.

Other sightseeing attractions in the center of Groningen are city hall, The Korenbeurs (a building where crops and goods were traded many years ago but now functions as a supermarket), another church called the AA Kerk and the main building of the University of Groningen.

### Nightlife
Groningen has a wide variety of bars and clubs to entertain the large population of students that live in the city. Almost every street in Groningen has at least one bar on it, which amounts to more than a hundred bars spread across Groningen.
