##Communication

* Lithuanian is the official national language, but most businessmen speak English and Russian.
* Meetings are arranged in advance and confirmed by a telephone call or e-mail. The agenda of the meeting is also arranged in advance.

> * There is a tradition of exchanging business cards during the first meeting.
> * Lithuanians are very punctual. You will definitely receive a phone call from a visitor a couple of minutes before meeting, if he feels he will be more than five minutes late. Visitors are also expected to arrive on time for every appointment.

##Decision-making

> * The decision-making process in Lithuania is relatively quick. You simply have to agree on a specific date with your partner, and a decision will be ready by that date.
> * Deadlines are expected to be honored. The planning process may be a little long and detailed, but once the planning is over, the project will move very quickly.

##Appearance

> * Business dress in Lithuania is conservative. Businessmen usually wear dark suits in the autumn and winter seasons. Light suits are worn in the summertime.
> * Businesswomen also dress conservatively, usually in dark suits and white blouses.

##Behavior

> * A handshake is customary at both the beginning and the end of a meeting, and when visiting a home. People that have worked together for years still shake hands each morning, as if it were the first time they were meeting. Be sure to look directly into the person's eyes while shaking hands.
* Lithuanians like to keep a larger personal space around them. The acceptable distance is the length of an outstretched arm.
* If attending dinner at a family residence, it is appropriate to bring a gift, such as a bottle of wine, dessert, or a bouquet of flowers for woman.
