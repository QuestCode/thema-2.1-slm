## Communication
Most communication shall be done in person and via the project its WhatsApp messenger group. When simple messaging falls short emails will be used. In the event of a high priority message or notification, direct contact must be used. This can be achieved by meeting the individual or group in person or a phone call. The project members should respond within 24 hours.

### Planning
Weekplanning will be done by Maurits van Mastrigt (project leader) in an online webapplication called Trello (https://trello.com/b/q3iyydCd/thema-2-1-i). This application allows for users to plan using cards, lists, and boards. This is the main planning, and should be checked regularly each group member.

### File sharing
Each file regarding the project will be shared via email or preferably the Github repository (https://github.com/mauvm/thema-2.1-i).

### Weekly meetings
Each week the entire group will gather to discuss the progress and planning of the given assignments. Each group member has the right to call an emergency meeting, which shall be held within 48 hours. These meetings also provide room for feedback, discussion, and requests for help (when needed).

### Working moments
Each project member will be available during week days from 9:00 AM until 4:00 PM, unless specifically communicated with the other project members in advance.

## Agreements regarding presence
The attendance during meetings is required. In case of absence there must be a valid reason given to the group, since someone can always be ill or have private issues. The responsibility to keep up-to-date, as well in our group as in lectures, is for the individual. If a project member is repeatedly absent, the other members will vote to determine consequences.

### Presence during lectures
Although the attendance in a lecture is not mandatory, the knowledge during a lecture is necessary for our learning task. Our group agreed on following these lectures so we can use the knowledge for our learning tasks. If someone is absence during a lecture, he should get the knowledge out of a book or from a group-member. He should also notify the lecturer about his absence.

Members may refuse to inform other members about the missed lectures or meetings. This prevents irritations among the members and attempts to motivate the less motivated.

### Presence during group meetings and deadlines
In case of meetings, consults or other appointments: a date, time and location will be discussed and agreed upon. Attendees are expected to be on time.

In a case where a group member is not able to attend the meeting, the project leader (or when not available: another member) must be informed via WhatsApp, e-mail, or preferably a phone call. This must be done at least one day in advance (an exception is made for circumstances beyond one's control). The project leader will communicate the member's access to the rest of the group.

Appointments regarding a deadline are determined in advance and no group member should have any reason for absency. These meetings have higher priorities, thus being absent with no valid reason has larger consequences.

In case of personal reasons or work duties, absence can be arranged in consultation with all present group members.

## Conflict situations
If a group member, disregarding the reason, fails to provide and fulfill his or her task - without alerting the group in advance - the consequences will be determined by the other group members through voting.

In most cases the solution will be the member attempting to find an alternative solution. In case of no alternative solutions, the other group members should be consulted to find a collective solution which all members agree with.

The group member will be warned if he fails to fulfill his task. If the group member has a valid reason, he will be informed that the warning is declared invalid.

In the event of a member not fulfilling his task twice - without a valid reason - he can be removed from the group and will no longer participate in the project. The tutor should be consulted before expelling a member from the project group.
