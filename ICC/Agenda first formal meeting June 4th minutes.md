### Improvement points other group
- Didn't look towards the floor when shaking hands.
- Immediately gave them the agenda but did start small talk after that.
- "That's the way how we do business there.".
- Kenyans didn't get a single word in for the first 5~10 minutes.

- 'Goes to some marketplace' <- Could be interpreted as an actual, physical market square.
- Assume every phone in Kenya is a smartphone with internet connection (be it Wi-Fi or 2G/3G).
- Promise future measurements (not predictions because they are not saving previous data).
- "Do we have to send the warnings ourselves?" answered "no" and "yes" at the same moment.
- Talked about Service Levels during the first meeting.
- Tom was more in control of the meeting than the UNWDMI.
- Said they had about 200 stations in Kenya while in reality there's only 17.

- Stephan saved the day by switching the offer to a texting, warning service instead.
