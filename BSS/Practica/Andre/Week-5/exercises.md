## Chapter 11

> _1.1 What are the advantages of the variation of linked allocation that uses a FAT to chain together the blocks of file?_

## Chapter 12

> _1.2 Could a RAID Level 1 organization achieve better performance for read requests than a RAID Level 0 organization (with nonredundant striping of data)? If so, how?_

## Chapter  13

> _1.3 What are the advantages and disadvantages of supporting memory-mapped I/O to devicecontrol registers_

> _1.4 Describe three circumstances under which blocking I/O should be used. Describe three circumstances under which nonblocking I/O should be used. Why not just implement nonblocking I/O and have processes busy-wait until their device is ready?_

## Chapter 16

> _1.5 Explain why doubling the speed of the systems on an Ethernet segment may result in decreased network performance. What changes could help solve this problem?_

> _1.6 The original HTTP protocol used TCP/IP as the underlying network protocol. For each page, graphic, or applet a separate TCP session was constructed, used and torn down. Because of the overhead of building and destroying TCP/IP connections, performance problems resulted from this implementation method. Would using UDP rather than TCP be a good alternative? What other changes could you make to improve HTTP performance?_
