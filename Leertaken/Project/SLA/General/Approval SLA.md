## 1.4 Approval Service Level Agreement

The approval of the SLA is a shared responsibility between the suppler and the client. If the SLA has to be altered, the responsibility for changing the SLA lies with the supplier. Permission for changes has to be given by the supplier. When changes have been made in the current SLA and the aspects of the service, the new SLA has to be agreed on by the supplier as well as the client.
