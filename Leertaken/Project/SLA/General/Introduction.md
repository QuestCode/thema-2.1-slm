## 1.3 Inleiding

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) applies to all by Da Vinci Data signed contracts between Da Vinci Data and the client. This SLA describes the scope and the general requirements of the service to be delivered by Da Vinci Data.

On initial delivery of the service, Da Vinci Data and the client will sign a service contract, this service contract describes what the requirements are under which the service will be supplied to the client. This contract can be altered by the supplier; changes in the contract will therefore prevail above the definitions in this SLA.

The percentages and goals in this SLA are based on the 'gold' service level. The differences between levels are defined in the paragraph _Levels of Service_.
