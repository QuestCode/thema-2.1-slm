## 4.4 Bonus and Malus

There are bonuses, fines or other penalties defined in this Service Level Agreement. When the promised requirements, as defined in chapter _1.4 Service Description_ are not fully met, a warning will be issued by the client. After a warning, Da Vinci Data will start an internal evaluation and investigation to determine why they failed to deliver on the promised requirements.

When three warnings have been issued by the client, Da Vinci Data as well as the client will evaluate the situation together and possibly alter the SLA in order to guarantee meeting the requirements.
