## 4.3 Trial period

This agreement has a trial period of six months. During this period, the set requirements and goals will be evaluated to determine whether they are realistic or not. 

At the end of the trial period, an extra report written based on the monthly Service Level Reports will be delivered. This report will describe every service and evaluate if each individual service requirement is reachable and which service requirements may need to be adjusted. Following the delivery of the report to the client, an evaluation will take place between the client and Da Vinci Data.

There are no bonus and malus arrangements during the trial period.
