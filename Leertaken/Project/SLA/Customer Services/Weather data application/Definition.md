The client wants to perform calculations on weather data to conduct research on climate change. The client is interested in climate change in Lithuania and other countries around the Baltic Sea and is especially interested in weather changes regarding the milder weather in the past years.
Da Vinci Data provides an application that allows the client to access the weather data.

The application will be used by 50 users who will all need a username and password in order to use the application. The service will be made available using an SSL connection. The application will be hosted in the Netherlands using a server that is property of the UNWMDI.

The supplier offers the following features in the application:

- A way for the customer to get a representation in which the rain fall of each weatherstation within 50 km of the coastline around the baltic sea is shown. (if the rain fall was more than 10 mm)
- A way for the customer to get a representation in which the temperature and humidity since the most recent midnight of any UNWDMI weather station is shown.
- A map showing weather stations with a colour code depending on the current temperature.
- A way for the customer to download data of the last 6 months in an Excel (files contain either a day, a week or a month of information)
