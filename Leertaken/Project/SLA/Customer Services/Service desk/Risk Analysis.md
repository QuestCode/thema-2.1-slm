### 2.2.2 Risk Analysis

The service desk can also be subject to several risks. Although some of these risks are highly unlikely the supplier must prepare for the consequences these might propose, as the supplier wants to warrant the availability.

#### Risk descriptions

| Risk                | Chance | Impact |
| :---                | :---   | :---   |
| Phone defects       | Low    | Medium |
| Online-chat failure | Medium | Low    |
| Email failure       | Low    | Low    |

The consequences of a phone defect is described as 'medium' because phone contact is the most efficient way of contacting the Service desk. Phone contact ensures a fast transfer of information and allows the service desk employee to question and troubleshoot with the user. A failure in the online-chat system has a higher probability but has no major consequences. When the online-chat function is no longer available, users will still be able to phone the Service desk. An email failure is also very unlikely and even though this is a preferred means of communication for users, it is not a very functional way of communication. Therefore, the supplier considers the consequences to be low and gives it a low impact.


#### Measures
In order to saveguard the availability of the Service desk the supplier will increase the response times of these means of communication. Depending on the service level (Gold, Silver, Bronze) there will be a higher response time of the Service desk. This ensures that whenever one of the risks occurs, users can fallback to one of the other means of communication.
