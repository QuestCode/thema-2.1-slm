### 2.2.2 Risk Analysis

The servicedesk can also be subject to several risks. Although some of these risks are highly unlikely we must prepare for the consequenses these might propose, as we want to warrant the availability.

#### Risk descriptions

| Risk                | Chance | Impact |
| :---                | :---   | :---   |
| Phone defects       | Low    | Medium |
| Online-chat failure | Medium | Low    |
| Email failure       | Low    | Low    |

The consequences of a phone defect is described as 'medium' because phone contact is the most efficient way of contacting the Servicedesk. Phone contact ensures a fast transfer of information and allows the servicedesk employee to 
question and troubleshoot with the user.
A failure in the online-chat system has a higher probability but has no major consequences. When the online-chat function is no longer availible users are still able to phone the Servicedesk.
An email failure is also very unlikely and although this is a preffered means of communication for users it is not a very functional way communication. Therefore we consider the consequences to be low and give it a low impact.


#### Measures
In order to saveguard the availability of the Servicedesk we will increase the responce times of these means of communication. Depending on the service level (Gold, Silver, Bronze) there will be a higher responce time of the Servicedesk. This ensures that whenever one of there risks occurs users can fallback to one of te other means of communication.
