## 5.2 Trial period report

At the end of the trial period, a report will be written based on the monthly Service Level Reports. In this report, all goals and requirements, expressed in Critical Success Factors (CSF) will be elaborated on. For each CSF the feasability and set goals will be listed and evaluated. 

When Da Vinci Data fails to meet a goal's requirements regularly (more than 3 months in a row), this goal can be deemed unfeasible and the goal's requirements have to be reevaluated. Goals will also have to be reevaluated if the set goal is not met by a wide margin. (for example 70% instead of 99% availability would be considered 'by a large margin')
