## 5.1 Service Review

Da Vinci Data will deliver a Service Level Report to the client on a monthly basis. This report will evaluate the goals set for each Critical Success Factor and the measured values for each CSF. This offers a clear overview of the desired quality of every service and whether or not these goals were accomplished. If the Critical Success Factors have not been met, this will be elaborated on in the report. Based upon this report, Da Vinci Data can determine where and if there's room for improvement in cooperation with the client.

The Service Level Report will be delivered within 10 days after the end of the month.

The enclosure _"Example Service Level Report.pdf"_ offers an example of what a Service Level Report would look like.
