### 3.1 Implementation costs

To set up the servicedesk to support the new weather data application, new hardware and servicedesk training/employees will be necessary. These processes cause implementation costs:

| Part                                                | Costs          |
| :---                                                | :---           |
| Hardware costs web interface (Dedicated Server etc) | € 8.000,-      |
| Service desk (extra staff, service desk hardware)   | € 2.000,-      |
| <div style="text-align:right">__Total:__</div>      | __€ 10.000,-__ |

After the execution of the implementation processes, changes and maintenance can cause other costs. For example, the supplier will keep maintaining the software, ensuring it is up to date and remains bug-free. The client is obliged to start using the new releases within 6 months after the supplier delivers a new release. The estimated cost for this service is __€2500,-__ yearly. This includes installation, delivery, convertion and education for the servicedesk staff.
