### 3.1 Implementation costs

To set up the service desk to support the new weather data application, new hardware and service desk training/employees will be necessary. These processes cause implementation costs:

| Part                                                      | Costs          |
| :---                                                      | :---           |
| Development wather data application                       | € 10.125,-     |
| Hardware costs weather data application (Webserver)       | € 4.900,-      |

| <div style="text-align:right">__Total:__</div>            | __€ 25.025,-__ |

After the execution of the implementation processes, changes and maintenance can cause other costs. For example, the supplier will keep maintaining the software, ensuring it is up to date and remains bug-free. The client is obliged to start using the new releases within 6 months after the supplier delivers a new release. The estimated cost for this service is __€2700,-__ yearly. This includes installation, delivery, convertion and education for the service desk staff.
