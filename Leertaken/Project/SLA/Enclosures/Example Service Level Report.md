# 4 Changes

There have not been any change requests during the period covered in this report.

# 5 Availability

The availabiltiy percentages of the Web Interface were slightly below the requirement, the suggested solution to the cause of this problem is evaluating the power provider availability and determining if switching to a different provider might guarantee less outages. However, two power outages both happening on Mondays before 12:00 is very rare and the supplier does not expect this to happen again.

# 6 Conclusion

During the month May, the goals and requirements regarding the Service Desk have all been accomplished. However, because of the two (rare) power outages both happening during the peak times of the availability requirements regarding the Web Interface, these goals were not fully met. 

The power outage also had a negative impact on the backup system which caused one backup to fail. Other than that there were no incidents regarding data confidentiality or integrity.
