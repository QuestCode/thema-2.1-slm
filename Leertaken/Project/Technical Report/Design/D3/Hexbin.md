### Hexbinning

To show the measurement a method called Hexbinning was used. This is a method to simplify many data points on a map to give a better visual indication of the actual measurements. With this methods data point are grouped in hexagons which can then be styled to give an indication fo the data within.

In the application the hexagons are styled in a way to indicate two possible values. Firstly the size of the hexagons give an indication of the amount of weatherstations within a hexagon. Secondly the color of the hexagon is determined by the average measurement of the weatherstations within a hexagon. For the baltic map the color indicates the amount of percipitation above 10mm, the hexagon is colored grey when below 10mm. For the world map the temperature is visualised by coloring the hexagons.
