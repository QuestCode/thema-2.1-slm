## 3.3 Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool to create lightweight virtual development environments. It is used for the development of the application to ensure that the developers would not run in platform specific issues. The virtual machine hosted a [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) installation installed with all the tools and software needed to run the application. Using the command `vagrant up` the machine is easily started and setup for development.

Vagrant proofed to be very helpful by ensuring that every developer could work on the application regardless of operation system.
