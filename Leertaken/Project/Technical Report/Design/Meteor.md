# Meteor

As the basis of the application Meteor was used. Meteor is JavaScript framework for both clientside as serverside. It features a terrific data synchronisation library which greatly helps with delivering realtime and up-to-date data. Meteor is built in such a way that whenever a change is made to the database (the Mongo database) those changes are automatically and instantly synchronized with the client. This means that no extra code had to be written to create a realtime view of all the measurements.

Meteor provides a rich set of packages which are thoroughly tested and widely supported. One such packages that was implemented is the 'accounts-password' package. This prebuilt package provides all the functionality for accounts that was required. Other packages which we could easily and directly use include: D3, Jquery, Iron-Router, Underscore and Bootstrap.
